# TechGrow_Task2_WeatherDashboard
This Weather Dashboard is a simple and responsive web application that fetches real-time weather data using WeatherAPI and displays it in a user-friendly interface. 
The dashboard provides essential weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall weather conditions. 
It also includes error handling to manage invalid city inputs. 
This project helped me gain hands-on experience in JavaScript, API calls, and front-end development while enhancing my problem-solving skills.
